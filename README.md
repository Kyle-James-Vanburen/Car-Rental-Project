## A fully organized, functional, and dynamic Excel dashboard project. Which helped build the informative PowerPoint to bring profitableness to the Lariat Car Rentals business team.

This project is broken up into seven KEY color coded Excel worksheets. GREEN for strategies. ORANGE for car insights. And BLUE for Branch insights.

BELLOW is a more informative insight on those seven sheets!

1. Strategies - This sheet consists of my strategies(total of 3) to help minimize cost and maximize profit it will show the comparisons of revenue, cost, and profit percentage.

2. Car Model Dashboard - This sheet lets you interact with the data, you choose the desired car you want to look at by selecting the car id in the slicer.

6. Car ID Pivot - This sheet is where I used to help create the dynamic model for my car dashboard.
   This sheet will give you all the information I used to calculate the baseline average data for the average car. And what car performed the best and worst.

7. Branch Pivot - This sheet is where I used to help create the dynamic model for my branch dashboard.
