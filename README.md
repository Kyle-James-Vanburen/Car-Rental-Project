# Excel-Car-Rental-Project

## Introduction ##

Lariat Car Rentals, aiming to optimize their operations, provided a comprehensive dataset encompassing car details, costs, revenues, and branch information. The primary objective was clear: identify high-performing vehicles and branches to maximize profits while minimizing costs. The dataset enabled a deep analysis, leading to valuable insights and strategic recommendations.

## Objectives ##

• Maximize Revenue: Determine top-performing vehicles and branches in terms of gross and net revenue.

• Minimize Costs: Devise strategies to reduce expenses while maintaining operational efficiency.

• Enhance Profitability: Balance vehicle inventory to boost profits without compromising customer service.

## Dataset Overview ##

• Car ID Mapping: Correlation of specific IDs with car make, model, and year.

• Car Costs: Monthly expenses and insurance costs for each vehicle.

• Car Revenue: Transaction data, rental duration, price, branch ID, and driver details.

• Branch Location: Branch ID (1-50), state, city, and airport location indicator.

## Key Findings ##

### Vehicle Performance ###
• Top Revenue Producer: Mitsubishi Eclipse stood out as the highest revenue-generating vehicle.

• Lowest Revenue Producer: The Jaguar XJ Series had the lowest gross revenue performance.

### Branch Performance ###
• Best Performing Branch: Branch #22 in St. Louis, Missouri emerged as the top revenue-generating branch.

• Least Performing Branch: Branch #27 in Las Vegas, Nevada demonstrated the lowest gross revenue performance.

## Strategic Recommendations ##

### Strategy 1: Optimize Inventory ###
**• Action:** Increase inventory by 20% (top 800 vehicles) based on profitability.

**• Impact:** Higher expenses but nearly 5% increase in net revenue, enhancing overall profit.

### Strategy 2: Trim Underperforming Vehicles ###
**• Action:** Sell off 20% (bottom 800 vehicles) with the worst gross revenue performance.

**• Impact:** Noticeable decrease in expenses and a near 5% profit increase.

### Strategy 3: Optimal Balance ###
**• Action:** Combine Strategy 1 & 2, maintaining the same quantity of vehicles (4,000).

**• Impact:** Highest percentage of profit; however, expenses are relatively higher.

## Recommendations and Call to Action ##
Based on the primary goal of maximizing profit, we strongly recommend implementing **Strategy 2**. Selling the least performing vehicles will significantly cut costs and substantially increase profits.

• **Sell 20% of Vehicles:** Drastic cost reduction leading to a substantial increase in net revenue.

• **Add 20% More Vehicles:** Expand the fleet to boost profits further.

• **Combined Approach:** Opt for both strategies to find the perfect balance between cost and profit.

**Important Note:** Taking no action may maintain the status quo, but it won't yield a decrease in cost or an increase in profit. Choose your strategy wisely for optimal results.
